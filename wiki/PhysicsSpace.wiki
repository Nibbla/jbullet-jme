#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics space
The PhysicsSpace defines the basic physics world in jbullet-jme. Things such as global gravity etc. are set here and all [PhysicsNode]s are added here.

== Creating the PhysicsSpace ==
The PhysicsSpace needs to be started by getting a PhysicsSpace Object with PhysicsSpace.getPhysicsSpace() and updated by calling the update(float time) method.

You can add options to the getPhysicsSpace() method to improve the physics performance.

== Adding physics objects ==
In order for [PhysicsNode]s and [PhysicsJoint]s to work, they need to be added to the PhysicsSpace by calling physicsSpace.add(node);

==Physics Speed==
You can alter the physics speed my multiplying the supplied update time value with an arbitrary number.

public void update(float tpf){
    physicsSpace.update(tpf*10);
