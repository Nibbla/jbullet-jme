#summary Special PhysicsNode that represents a vehicle
The PhysicsVehicleNode is a special PhysicsNode that represents a vehicle in the physics space and can have wheels and be controlled via acceleration, steering etc.
==Adding a wheel==
When adding a wheel you have to specify the jme spatial that acts as the wheel, its translation in respect to the car and its axes/radius etc. then the spatial will act like the wheel of the vehicle.

==Accessing wheels==
To access a single wheel, for example to get its current tracktion, you can use the physicsVehicleNode.getWheelInfo(int wheelNumber) method. You will get a WheelInfo object that you can use to get and set info on the wheel.

==Shifting the center of mass==
