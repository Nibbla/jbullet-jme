#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics space
The PhysicsSpace defines the basic physics world in jbullet-jme. Things such as global gravity etc. are set here and all [PhysicsNode]s are added here.

The PhysicsSpace needs to be started by getting a PhysicsSpace Object and updated by calling the update(float time) method on that Object. A syncPhysics() method synchronizes the physics and jme objects and is called seperately to allow multithreading and/or different decoupling techniques between the OpenGL and Physics engine. (May change until release version)

==Updating sequence==
  * update(float time) - can be run in parallel to anything else, data is capsuled
   * physics update run
  * syncPhysics() - should be run when update() is done / not running
   * collision events get dispatched
   * jme2 node input gets applied to physics
   * physics state gets applied to jme2 nodes
