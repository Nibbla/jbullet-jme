#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics object

A PhysicsNode represents an object in the physics space and in the jme scenegraph. It is derived from com.jme.scene.Node to integrate nicely with the jme2 scenegraph.
For bullet, it stores a RigidBody and its CollisionShape including their options (friction, mass etc.)

==Notes==
Currently, mesh objects do not collide with other mesh objects, so mesh objects are mostly to be used for static objects (floor/world) while box/sphere etc. shapes should be used for mobile objects.
