#summary Special PhysicsNode that represents a vehicle
This special PhysicsNode represents a vehicle in the physics space and can have wheels and be controlled via acceleration, steering etc.
==Adding a wheel==
When adding a wheel you have to specify the jme spatial that acts as the wheel, its translation in respect to the car and its axes/radius etc.
{{{
physicsVehicleNode.addWheel(Spatial wheel, Vector3f wheelLocalTranslation, wheelDirection, wheelAxle,
                             suspensionRestLength, wheelRadius, boolean frontWheel);
}}}
