This is the basic way of connecting [PhysicsNode](PhysicsNode.md)s. Although bullet calls these "constraints" in this implementation I call them "joints" because some bullet constraints are used via special [PhysicsNode](PhysicsNode.md)s directly, not via "joints" (e.g. [PhysicsVehicleNode](PhysicsVehicleNode.md)).
