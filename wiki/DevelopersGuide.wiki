#summary Developers guide for jbullet-jme

== Introduction ==
jbullet-jme is a pretty straightforward jbullet wrapper.

jbullet-jme mostly encapsules jbullet objects in similar own objects and makes the methods of the jbullet objects accessible, mostly by mirroring them. So to understand jbullet-jme it is advised to look at jbullet / bullet.

Some objects integrate functions of RigidBodys with Constraints, such as PhysicsVehicleNode or PhysicsCharacterNode.
