#summary Special node that represents a character

== Introduction ==
The bullet CharacterController is pretty basic, its aim is performance with lots of character nodes, not realism. For something more advanced, I'd suggest building up the character from multiple PhysicsNodes.

*Rotation*: the character node itself is not supposed to turn. You animate or turn your added spatial/mesh. The CharacterNode is just for collision and location.
