#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics object

A PhysicsNode represents an object in the physics space and in the jme scenegraph. It is derived from com.jme.scene.Node to integrate nicely with the jme2 scenegraph.
For bullet, it stores a RigidBody and its CollisionShape including their options (friction, mass etc.)

==Usage==
To create a PhysicsNode, just create a new PhysicsNode Object like this
{{{
new PhysicsNode(physicsSpace,spatial,shapeType, mass);
}}}
and add it to your jme2 scenegraph.

The given spatial will be the added as child node or geometry of the PhysicsNode and will thus move with the PhysicsNode.

The shapeType is one of PhysicsNode.Shapes.XXX and defines what kind of shape the PhysicsNode has in the physics space, the size of the shape is dependent on the BoundingVolume of this PhysicsNode.

==Notes==
Currently, mesh objects do not collide with other mesh objects, so mesh objects are mostly to be used for static objects (floor/world) while box/sphere etc. shapes should be used for mobile objects.
