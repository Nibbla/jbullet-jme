#summary How jbullet-jme works
#labels Phase-Design,Featured

= Introduction =

The aim of jbullet-jme is to simplify the use of jbullet and adapt it to jme2. 

jbullet-jme is similar to jmephysics2 in that it completely wraps a physics engine into its own set of objects. These objects integrate into the scenegraph of jme2 and are updated by the phyiscs engine to move according to the phyiscs.

Other than jmephysics2, which aims at integrating different physics engines in one wrapper library, jbullet-jme is pretty much tailored to bullet. This allows using some of the special functions of bullet (like vehicles) but makes the wrapper more difficult to port to other physics implementations.
Still, wrapping jbullet like its done here keeps the possibility of developing a native bullet implementation of jbullet-jme in the future, supporting SPU/GPU use etc. (see Native_Version)

== JME integration ==
[PhysicsNode]s are normal JME nodes that are updated by the physics thread. So to have some phyiscs object in your world, you first create the jme geometry you'd like to move. Then you create a PhysicsNode with that object as a child. The PhysicsNode now contains all information about the location, rotation etc. of your physics object. The created geometry moves with it in the jme scenegraph, creating... visible physics :)

== Details ==
*All details are subject to change until first release*

The PhysicsSpace Object stores the basic physics space information and starts the jbullet physics space upon construction.

A PhysicsNode represents a Node in jme and a RigidBody in jbullet.

It has all normal functions of a jme Node and its location and rotation is updated by the RigidBody in the physics space. If the location or rotation is set from the jme side, it is updated on the physics side.

A PhysicsJoint represents a Constraint in jbullet that connects two physics objects.
