 * <i>From bullet manual:</i><br>
 * This generic constraint can emulate a variety of standard constraints,
 * by configuring each of the 6 degrees of freedom (dof).
 * The first 3 dof axis are linear axis, which represent translation of rigidbodies,
 * and the latter 3 dof axis represent the angular motion. Each axis can be either locked,
 * free or limited. On construction of a new btGeneric6DofConstraint, all axis are locked.
 * Afterwards the axis can be reconfigured. Note that several combinations that
 * include free and/or limited angular degrees of freedom are undefined.
