#summary Basic jbullet-jme Phyiscs Joint

This is the basic way of connecting [PhysicsNode]s. Although bullet calls these "constraints" in this implementation I call them "joints" because some bullet constraints are used via special [PhysicsNode]s directly, not via "joints" (e.g. [PhysicsVehicleNode]).
