#summary Multithreading in jbullet-jme

== Introduction ==
jbullet-jme has been developed in a way that makes it easy to integrate it into multithreaded applications.

== Details ==
The synchronization of jme and the physics happens when PhyiscsSpace.syncPhysics() is called. The actual physics update() call is separated and can be called synchronously to other tasks.

TODO: extend
== Queues ==
jbullet-jme uses the GameTaskQueueManager of jme to allow queueing of phyiscs tasks.
{{{
GameTaskQueue pQueue=GameTaskQueueManager.getManager().getQueue("jbullet_sync");
