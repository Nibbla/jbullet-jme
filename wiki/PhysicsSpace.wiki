#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics space

=PhysicsSpace - Basic jbullet-jme physics space=

A PhysicsNode represents an object in the physics space and in the jme scenegraph. It is derived from com.jme.scene.Node to integrate nicely with the jme2 scenegraph.
For bullet, it stores a RigidBody and its CollisionShape including their options (friction, mass etc.)

==Usage==
The PhysicsSpace needs to be started by creating a PhysicsSpace Object like this
{{{
new PhysicsSpace();
}}}
and updated by calling the update(float time) method. The syncPhysics() method synchronizes the physics and jme objects and is called seperately to allow multithreading and/or different decoupling techniques between the OpenGL and Physics engine.
Bullet internally works with 60 frames/s... TODO: extend
