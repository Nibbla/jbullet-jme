#summary Basic jbullet-jme physics space
The PhysicsSpace defines the basic physics world in jbullet-jme. Things such as global gravity etc. are set here and all [PhysicsNode]s are added here.

The PhysicsSpace needs to be started by getting a PhysicsSpace Object and updated by calling the update(float time) method.
