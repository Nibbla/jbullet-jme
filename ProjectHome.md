jbullet-jme is a jBullet physics library adapter for jMonkeyEngine2. It aims at simplifying the use of the jbullet/bullet physics library in jme2 projects.

It does so by integrating jbullet features into a set of simple to use physics objects that play nicely with jme2.

jME3 includes an improved version of this adapter as the default physics implementation.

Project Status: **alpha**

This project also includes a branched version of jbullet that adds some functions to character and terrain.
