#summary How collision shapes work in jbullet-jme

== Introduction ==
In jbullet-jme, CollisionShapes get drived from the jme BoundingVolume of a Spatial.
When you create a PhysicsNode with a spatial and shape type, the corresponding BoundingVolume is created on the PhysicsNode and a CollisionShape is automatically derived from that.
If you want the shape to be different than the auto-generated one, you can set a BoundingVolume to the PhysicsNode and call createCollisionShape(int type) to recreate the corresponding CollisionShape.
